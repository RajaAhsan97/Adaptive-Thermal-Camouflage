# Adaptive-Thermal-Camouflage
ADD INTRODUCTION HERE FOR THE ABSTRACT OF PROJECT

TERMS and their definition
  i. camou-pixel: Hexagonal-shaped geometric structure designed on which the thermal gradient of the background scenario is transformed on it with the aid of Active heating/cooling elements                   - termed as ThermoElectric Coolers (TECs). 

1.  Prior to the experimental setup, I have created the pseudo-simulation environment in the Finite Element Machine (FEM) software i.e COMSOL Multiphysics. And written the sample code in Python, for viewing the thermal gradient developed on the surface of camou-pixel.
    cam_plate_thermal_pattern_visualization.py -----> PYTHON file  
    hex_grids_data(20 sec).txt -----> sample file exported from FEM simulation software
